      Pizza had saved my life when I was small. I was a very picky eater when I was a toddler and there was a chance that I would never learn hwo to eat anything...until I saw an episode of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. That cartoon introduced me to the magical world of pizza and I have never really left.

      <p>As a New Yorker, I am always drawn to the triangular slice of heaven that is the national dish of my home.
      It's warm, cheesy and about the cheapest lunch you can get in one of the most expensive cities in the world.</p>
      <br>
      <p>But I am also partial to Chicago Deep Dish, portable Hot Pockets, Detroit Pizza Pie, old-fashioned Grandma Pies, artisian pizza made from the Brick Oven and much more.</p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Round or Square, Thin or Thick, Frozen or Baked, I love all things Pizza!
